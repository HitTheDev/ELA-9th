    <p style="font-size:30px"> A theme in Dead Poets Society is parental pressure and obedience. For example, Mr.Perry is forcing Neil Perry, his son, to follow his orders and not attend his extra circular classes that he is doing. Mr.Perry wants him to do only the classes he thinks will help him in the future. Neil decides to take musical theatre and performs against his fathers will Mr.Perry. This conveys that there was some parental pressure in the movie which was related to the main character Neil Perry. The movie has parental pressure that is actually SO related to what happens to most students, in their school years. </p>
